# deltachat-ios
Email-based instant messaging for iOS.

- after cloning, go to the top level directory of the project and run 'pod install' (Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Xcode). See https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html

- then, open deltachat-ios.xcworkspace (*not* deltachat-ios.xcodeproj ), e.g. by typing 'open deltachat-ios.xcworkspace' from the shell. Will add some basic instructions in the README soon
